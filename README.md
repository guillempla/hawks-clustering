Project made for the UOC's Data Mining subject (PAC2).

The objective of this small data mining project was to learn how clustering with R works.

## Data

Students and faculty at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, collected data over many years at the hawk blind at Lake MacBride near Iowa City, Iowa. The data set that we are analyzing here is a subset of the original data set, using only those species for which there were more than 10 observations. Data were collected on random samples of three different species of hawks: Red-tailed, Sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.
